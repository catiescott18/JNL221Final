   Closing the gender pay gap and reducing gender-based inequality in medicine has been a project that healthcare providers have been attempting to tackle for years. Though strides have been made to narrow the gap, there is still a fair bit of distance to go. 
  </p>
  <p>
    In 2016, the average pay gap as a percentage in the healthcare field was 21.56%, and skyrocketed to 60.67% when narrowed down to just doctors and physicians. The change in the average gender pay gap in the United States is only 0.1% between the years of 2016 and 2023, and the difference in medicine specifically hasn’t looked much different.

    <a href= "https://www.who.int/news/item/13-07-2022-women-in-the-health-and-care-sector-earn-24-percent-less-than-men"> According to the World Health Organization</a>, the raw gender pay gap within medical fields as of 2022 was about 20%, but increased to 24% when factoring in age, education, and working time. Much of this wage gap remains unexplained and will most likely remain that way, as in most private healthcare companies, pay basis is mostly up to the whims of individual employers. 
  </p>
  <p>
    “I remember being relieved as a medical intern when my male peers would get called on for answers more than I would,” recalled Dr. Erin O’Shea-Paudel, a pulmonologist at Reliant Medical Group in Worcester, MA. “But even today, after everything, I walk into a patient’s room and people still assume I’m the nurse.”
  </p>
  <p>
    Dr. O’Shea-Paudel started as a student at Worcester Polytechnic Institute interested in becoming a research scientist, but was more interested in healthcare itself and was discouraged by how outnumbered she was by men in her classes (a 4:1 ratio of men to women, to be exact). Today, efforts have been made to increase the number of female faculty members in pre-health education. Students such as Addy Sprague, studying health and exercise science on a pre-physical therapy track at Syracuse University, are experiencing a much more even ratio of male to female faculty, motivating them to stick with their chosen field. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Upon switching to medicine, she had a daunting amount of experience to acquire before she would be able to enter her field of choice: four years of a bachelor’s degree, four years of a master’s degree, three years of internal medicine residency, one year of a sleep medicine fellowship, and three more years of pulmonary and critical care training, amounting to 15 years total of medical training. 
  </p>
  <p>
    And yet, while the male interns under her supervision are already being called “doctor” in the workplace, Dr. O’Shea-Paudel is still fighting for people to stop referring to her as Erin. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Even though healthcare is typically female-dominated — 67% of the global field accounted for by women — most of the faculty that Dr. O’Shea-Paudel worked with in her extensive educational journey were men, as are most of her counterparts today. Pulmonology is known to be on the higher-paying end of medical specialties, and as is the case for most high-paying fields, is mostly male-dominated. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Despite the amount of experience that male and female physicians alike in Dr. O’Shea-Paudel’s field must acquire before entering their field of choice, the discrimination that female doctors face is unparalleled. According to the World Health Organization, gender wage gaps tend to be greater in higher paying categories where men are overrepresented and women are underrepresented. Most medical compensation is “competency-based” and individualized to each physician, and is not discussed within the workplace, allowing female physicians to be lowballed time and time again.

  <p>
    According to Dr. O’Shea-Paudel, at Reliant Medical Group specifically, most of the practicing physicians’ pay is based upon two things: RVUs (Relative Value Units, which refers to how much a particular task in a particular specialty is worth), and their Press Ganey ratings. 
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2772682">Press Ganey ratings</a> are an initiative taken by Medicare to improve patient satisfaction in terms of comfort and hospitality, but they tend to skew in unfair ways. 
  </p>
  <p>
    “If your Press Ganey ratings are good, at least within Reliant, you can get up to a $20,000 bonus,” explained Dr. O’Shea-Paudel. “But if they’re bad, you can also lose that much. It’s not an insignificant amount.”
  </p>
  <p>
    According to the Journal of the American Medical Association, patient satisfaction often lies within their racial/ethnic and gender concordance with their physicians. When the majority of patients that a particular group sees are white men — who were also within the majority of patients surveyed for JAMA’s study — women and people of color take the fall, and are statistically rated lower, directly affecting their pay. 
  </p>
  <p>
    However, this is not the only case. <a href="https://urology.stanford.edu/content/dam/sm/urology/JJimages/publications/Physician-gender-is-associated-with-press-ganey-patient-satisfaction-scores-in-outpatient-gynecology.pdf">According to research done by Stanford</a>, male outpatient gynecologists are also consistently rated higher than their female counterparts, and theoretically, the majority of their patient base is women. Thus, the problem here is larger than it once seemed. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Today, students on pre-health tracks are aware of these issues and working to change them. Sprague acknowledges the difficulties she will face in her field and is ready to face them head on.
  </p>
  <p>
    “As women, we’re told not to ask for or pursue the things that we want,” Sprague said. “But I’ve been working to make sure my [male] peers view me as an equal, and they know I won’t let them walk over me.”
  </p>
  <p>
    Similarly, incoming Fairfield University nursing student Clare Jackson is already anticipating having to work harder than her male counterparts to receive equal treatment within the field of medicine.
  </p>
  <p>
    “It’s upsetting that I’ll have to work that much harder for equal recognition, but I’m not surprised,” Jackson said. “I want to help make a change, even if it’s small. It all starts somewhere.”
